      <p>Creating strong passwords that are both secure and memorable can seem like an impossible task. Here's our guide to making it work:</p>

      <h2>The Passphrase Method</h2>
      <p>Instead of a single word with special characters, use a phrase that's meaningful to you. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a memorable phrase: "I love eating pizza on Friday nights!"</li>
        <li>Convert it to a password: "iL0vePizza0nFri!"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Works</h2>
      <p>This method creates passwords that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Long enough to be secure (12+ characters)</li>
        <li>Include mixed case, numbers, and special characters</li>
        <li>Based on something you'll remember</li>
        <li>Unique to you</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Never use personal information like birthdays or names</li>
        <li>Use different passwords for each account</li>
        <li>Consider using a password manager</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Myth 1: Changing Passwords Frequently Improves Security</h2>
      <p>Regular password changes were once considered best practice, but this can actually lead to weaker passwords. Instead, focus on creating strong, unique passwords and change them only when necessary.</p>

      <h2>Myth 2: Complex Character Requirements Equal Security</h2>
      <p>While special characters can help, length is more important than complexity. A longer passphrase can be more secure than a short, complex password.</p>

      <h2>Myth 3: Password Managers Are Risky</h2>
      <p>Quality password managers are actually one of the best ways to improve your security. They help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate strong, random passwords</li>
        <li>Store passwords securely</li>
        <li>Use unique passwords for every account</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Truth About Password Security</h2>
      <p>Focus on these proven practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use long, unique passwords</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication</li>
        <li>Use a reputable password manager</li>
        <li>Stay alert for security breaches</li>
      </ul>
